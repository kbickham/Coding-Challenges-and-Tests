# Code Challeneges and Tests
I first attempted coding in qbasic/visual basic as a kid. When I got to high school I seemed to do well and took three years of AP Computer Science at Allen High School.

After leaving school to puruse martial arts I stopped coding. Upon re-entering school to pursue and engineering degree I discovered that I genuinely enjoy coding embedded systems. That being said, my approaches and style are somewhat sloppy. The skillset that I currently posses requires refinement and diretion. I am catalogging the tests and challenge problems I complete, furthering my education into computer science/software engineering. I may not be the best right now, but the derivative of my utility in this regard will always be positive.
