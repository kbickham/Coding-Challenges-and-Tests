# Code Challeneges and Tests
I first attempted coding in qbasic/visual basic as a kid. When I got to high school I seemed to do well and took three years of AP Computer Science at Allen High School using Borland Turbo C++ 3.After leaving school to puruse martial arts I stopped coding. Upon re-entering school to pursue and engineering degree I discovered that I genuinely enjoy coding embedded systems. That being said, my approaches and style are somewhat sloppy. The skillset that I currently posses requires refinement and diretion. I am catalogging the tests and challenge problems I complete, furthering my education into computer science/software engineering. I may not be the best right now, but the derivative of my utility in this regard will always be positive.  I am attempting to retrieve my code from those years as my first year project... is perhaps the piece of code (top scrolling space shooter based on the TV Series Red Dwarf) that I am most proud of. In the meantime, I'm currently utilizing:

CheckIO to learn Python - https://py.checkio.org/

Coursera course on embedded software engineering - https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-embedded-systems/
