Keeping track of my solutions to checkio problems. Moving from C languages to Python

These are my solutions to the problems on py.checkio.org
I come from a C language background. I can get by in VHDL, but I'm learning Python so I can modernize my skillset.
I'll be honest, python isn't much in terms of performance but you really can do alot, with a little bit of code.

I must say, I do really like the set of problems and interface on checkio. They have one for python and another for javascript.
I'm trying to do a little bit every day while I'm studying for the FE Exam. Check it out if you're interested in learning.
