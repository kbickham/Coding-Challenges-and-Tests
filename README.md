# Code Challeneges and Tests
I am catalogging the tests and challenge problems. I may not be the best right now, but the derivative of my utility will always be positive. 

CheckIO to learn Python - https://py.checkio.org/

Coursera course on embedded software engineering - https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-embedded-systems/

Ignore github, this is Python, C, and C++ currently. I will later revist my VHDL processor once I get my own FPGA kit. I learned a lot about how processors work in the at project and highly suggest it to anyone wanting to learn about computer hardware.
