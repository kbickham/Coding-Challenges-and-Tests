# Embedded C and C++

Developing this skillset is my primary goal right now. My skills are a combination of old C++ before the ISO standard and just self taught solutions I have made work in Engineering school. I realize that it's important to develop good coding pratices if I want to be a good engineer... it's way harder to unlearn things than it is to learn things the right way initially. It's true in fighting/martial arts... I'm just going to assumee it's true here as well.

After takeing the Firmware Test 1 and somewhat dissapointed with my performance, I have enrolled in this course on Coursera. https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-embedded-systems

I do not currently have a a MSP432
