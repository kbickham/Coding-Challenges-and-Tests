# Embedded C and C++

Developing this skillset is my primary goal right now. My skills are a combination of old C++ before the ISO standard and just self taught solutions I have made work in Engineering school. I realize that it's important to develop better coding pratices if I want to improve as an embedded engineer... it's way harder to unlearn things than it is to learn things the right way initially. It's true in fighting/martial arts... I'm just going to assumee it's true here as well.

After takeing the Firmware Test 1 and somewhat dissapointed with my performance, therefore I have enrolled in this course on Coursera. https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-embedded-systems

I do not currently have a a MSP432. 

Until I have purchased one, I'm waiting on a blue pill (small stm32 dev board, I just ordered 2 for 10$ from amazon) and am using the book: "Beginning STM32 by Warren Gay"
