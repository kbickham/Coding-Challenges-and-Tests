# Embedded C and C++

Developing this skillset is my primary goal right now. My skills are a combination of old C++ before the ISO standard and just self taught solutions I have made work in Engineering school. I realize that it's important to develop better coding pratices if I want to improve as an embedded engineer... it's way harder to unlearn things than it is to learn things the right way initially. It's true in fighting/martial arts... I'm just going to assumee it's true here as well.

After takeing the Firmware Test 1 and somewhat dissapointed with my performance, therefore I have enrolled in this course on Coursera. https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-embedded-systems

I do not currently have a a MSP432. 

Until I have purchased one, I'm will be working on the blue pill (small stm32 dev board, I just ordered 2 for 10$ from amazon) and am using the book: "Beginning STM32 by Warren Gay". The biggest thing I wish yo do is get used to developing firmwaer using the opensource toolchain utilized by this book in a linux environment. Funny thing is, I have bodhi linux running on 2 machines (old pc's I'm sprucing up specifically for this purpose but they don't have wireless cards right now) in my apartment, but none of them has an internet connection currently so I'm still using VirtualBox.
