# Most Wanted Letter (py.checkio.org)

Problem link: https://py.checkio.org/en/mission/most-wanted-letter/

I am going to better organize these challenges. Initially I will plan our my code, and this implement it.
Any notes or written work will be included now in each problem's directory. These problems are still pretty simple,
but I'm running out of the easy ones... and this format will become increasingly pertinent,

It's a little cheeseball I feel...using the statistics mode functions, but oh well... isn't that what python is good for? 
Force string into lower case in a list, iterate over slices and mutate (removing anything with ascii value under 65.... orignally the numerics kept winning the min battle on the return line), then return the min of the mode. Pretty simple in the end.
